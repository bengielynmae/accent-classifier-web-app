# accent-classifier-web-app
This is a deployment of an accent classifier model to a simple web application using flask. 

The model used in this project is originally from my partner's machine learning [project](https://kykyleoh.github.io/portfolio/accent-detection/). You can see his other works [here](https://kykyleoh.github.io)
